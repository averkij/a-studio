## üìñ Overview

Lingtrain Studio is a powerful, open-source application designed for aligning texts in different languages. It leverages machine learning models to create high-quality parallel corpora, which can be used for a variety of purposes, including training translation models, creating bilingual books, and for language learning.

The application provides a user-friendly interface for aligning texts, as well as a tool for translators to edit and refine the alignments. It also supports a variety of models, allowing users to choose the best one for their specific needs.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Accurate Text Alignment**: Utilizes state-of-the-art sentence embedding models to accurately align texts in different languages.
- **Parallel Corpus Creation**: Extracts parallel corpora from two texts, which can be used for a variety of downstream tasks.
- **Bilingual Book Formatter**: Creates formatted parallel books with sentence highlighting, making them ideal for language learners.
- **Model Flexibility**: Supports a variety of sentence embedding models, including `distiluse-base-multilingual-cased-v2`, `LaBSE`, and `SONAR`.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides a simple and intuitive interface for aligning texts and editing alignments.
- **Dockerized Deployment**: Can be easily deployed on a local machine or a server using Docker.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Backend

The backend is a Flask/uwsgi REST API service that contains all the alignment logic.

1. **Navigate to the backend directory:**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the backend application:**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Frontend

The frontend is a Vue.js single-page application that provides the user interface for the application.

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the frontend application:**
